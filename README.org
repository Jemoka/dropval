How well does your Roberta/BERT do at self consistency tasks? IDK. Maybe you
want to find out?

#+begin_src bash
python main.py my_funni_experiment ${TASK} ./path/to/a/roberta/or/bert --wandb
#+end_src

where =$TASK= is your choice of =bmask= (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02066),
=mend= (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11309), =squad=
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250), =consistency=
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01017), or =kn=
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08696).

Coming soon is also ReFT or LoRA.


good vibes
